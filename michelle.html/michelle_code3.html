<h1>Sally Duck Waits...</h1>

<p>Sally Duck gets scared by the car sounds and dangers of the road. But Sally knows she is safer if she waits on the street for her family to come back for her.Sally trembles hoping her family did not forget about her. Minutes pass, and Sally looks around for hope, she sees a herd of her wonderful Duck family. They run to her and she runs to them.</p> 

<p>Mother Duck says,"Smart Sally!It is a good thing you stayed in place, so we could retrace our steps to find you"</p>
